This little site is a place for some of my blogging, whatever stage of life it's in ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ¿ ðŸŒ³

With digital gardens, you openly share interesting ideas and your thoughts. The documents grow in tandem with yourself

~~I have a reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to my shorter front legs; I'm roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body.~~

This site was made with [Paul's Digital Garden Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-digital-garden-theme). Crafting this website from an initial idea into a functioning webpage was super simple - more on this here
