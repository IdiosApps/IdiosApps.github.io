Ever since COVID became a thing in our daily lives, remote work has become more prevalent. Whilst there's a huge amount to gain from remote working, we do lose those colloquial chats by the water cooler or board/card games in lunch breaks.

In my experience, it's common for companies to offer a 1-2 hour social meeting on Fridays - maybe just to chat, or with a game at the forefront.

It's been a few years now since COVID started, and we've all tried lots of games. Here's a list of games you should try, and what I think about them.

| Game           | Rating / 5 stars | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| [TagPro](https://tagpro.koalabeast.com/)         | 5          |    Gameplay will be 90% of the focus of your social. Great fun - be sure to make an account and change your name so you can get more teamwork going on!         |
| [TeamBridge.app](https://www.teambridge.app/) | 3.5        |     There's 6 free games, but they're pretty quiet. For example, Cosel ("broken telephone") has e.g. 10 people drawing and describing plenty of images, which takes a lot of focus; the fun comes when the whole group sees how words evolved. But it's cute and there's variety, so give it a try one week!         |
| [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/)            |    4        |    You're either drawing or typing in a thoughtful frenzy to guess what one player's drawing is. I like how this game keeps everyone involved, and is leninet on spelling mistakes.         |

| Globle           |    4        |     guess where a mystery country is!         |
| Among Us [PC (paid)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) / [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en_GB&gl=US) / [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404)            |     3.5 chickens ðŸ¤·      |      People were genuinely playing this every day at work during the height of its popularity. I didn't really *"get"* it, but I've seen that it's a fantastic social game     |
