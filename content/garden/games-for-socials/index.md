Ever since COVID became a thing in our daily lives, remote work has become more prevalent. Whilst there's a huge amount to gain from remote working, we do lose those colloquial chats by the water cooler or board/card games in lunch breaks.

In my experience, it's common for companies to offer a 1-2 hour social meeting on Fridays - maybe just to chat, or with a game at the forefront.

It's been a few years now since COVID started, and we've all tried lots of games. Here's a list of games you should try, and what I think about them.

# Free

| Game                                     | Rating / 5 stars | Description                                                                                                                                          |

| [TagPro](https://tagpro.koalabeast.com/) | 5                | Gameplay will be 90% of the focus of your social. Great fun - be sure to make an account and change your name so you can get more teamwork going on! |

| [VirtualVacation](https://virtualvacation.us) | 4                | Like GeoGuessr, but with a video - and everyone can have their own guess!         

| [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com) | 4                | Move around Google Maps Streetview and work as a team to guess where you are!

| [QuackStanley](https://quackstanley.net/)                                               | 5                | Much like Snakeoil, a “buyer” is offered goods from each other player in turn (based on a choice of 2 of 4 topics). Weird and creative, and super fast to pick up                                                                                                                                        |
| [Countdown](https://surelook.github.io/countdown/)                                      | 4.5              | The classic British game CountDown, with both word/number/pre-generated anagram challenges, a big block, and even the music!  Everyone plays at the same time, and competes to find the highest score.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/)                                             | 4                | You're either drawing or typing in a thoughtful frenzy to guess what one player's drawing is. I like how this game keeps everyone involved, and is leninet on spelling mistakes                                                                                                                          |

| [Globle](https://globle-game.com/)                                                      | 4                | Guess where a mystery country is!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [TeamBridge.app](https://www.teambridge.app/)                                           | 3.5              | There's 6 free games, but they're pretty quiet. For example, Cosel ("broken telephone") has e.g. 10 people drawing and describing plenty of images, which takes a lot of focus; the fun comes when the whole group sees how words evolved. But it's cute and there's variety, so give it a try one week! |
| [Chameleon](https://chameleon-roan.vercel.app/)                                         | 3                | For a category (animals, fruits, etc.) all but one player see the same word. They give clues to show they know what the word is - but not enough obvious information so that the "chameleon" can guess the word and blend in with the group!                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Wavelength](https://gjeuken.github.io/telewave/)                                       | 2.5              | An ingenius digital board for the game "Wavelength" - be sure to read the instructions. I find it so difficult to think of a word on the spot such that this game isn't really fun to me - but discussing and guessing other people's words is OK                                                        |
