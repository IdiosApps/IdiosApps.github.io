// Reference back to clickbait summary

// CTA - try out some new fonts in new places

// https://www.codingfont.com/
// 16 fonts battle to see your preference
// Not sure exactly which features are being compared / what the idea is to detect your preferences in a decent way (curvy characters, dash in centre or raised, 'g's with a squiggle under, etc.)
// Sometimes two fonts have similar features / aims, and it can be hard to see major differences
// My winner was Azreto Mono

# Interesting fonts to check out 

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/M+PLUS+Code+Latin?query=Coji+Morishita
  - For me, blocks of text are very readable and feel "solid" without being crammed
  - Letters 'r', and 'c' are interesting - and 'g' is nice (but looks like a 9)
- PragmataPro
  - $20 minimum, but has a crazy amount of ligature support which is worth seeing
    - Playing cards, boxes, a "Needle" (?)... and even a [metro map](https://fsd.it/2017/05/02/pragmatapro-0-825-more-pros/) is possible!
