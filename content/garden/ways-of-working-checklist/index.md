Every team will figure out their own unique ways of working through "Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing" - but here are some techniques that I've seen provide lots of value - usually with little effort!

‚úè Why not take a note of each one you aren't using yet as you read?

# GitHub 

## PR Templates

Open source projects often have multiple PR templates, to help capture context on [bug reports, feature requests, and security vulnerabilities.](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#issue-templates)

In your team's day-to-day repositories, it's likely you aren't using templates. Maybe they "get in the way" and "just get deleted", but these two features might make it more interesting!

### Markdown comments

GitHub uses MarkDown (their own special flavour of MarkDown, really) - and it supports comments:

`example md comment`

These comments are only visible when editing - you can't see them on the posted description. 
You can use comment to give friendly reminders on:
- Providing context
- Linking to the ticket (rather than paraphrasing all that context!)
- Ensuring tests (unit, integration, performance) are covered
  - You could give a commented-out checklist if you want

### AutoLinks

In each GitHub repository, you can set up "AutoLinks". They're basically an autogenerated, tidy hyperlink.

The GitHub Docs give a good example - but I'll extract a snippet and save you getting distracted:
- Reference prefix: `JIRA-`
- Target URL: `https://jira.example.com/issue?query=<num>`
- Preview: `JIRA-123` is converted to `https://jira.example.com/issue?query=123`

Combined with templates, you can ensure that every PR has a short link to the relevant tickets.
This is much better than just having the ticket number (and no link) in the title/description/branch/commits:
- It saves the PR author time in making these links
- It saves the reviewers time fishing around in Jira and getting distracted
- It ensures everyone has easily accessible context, so the PR description can focus on the actual changes

Until I knew this I was using an Espanso text expansion macro `:JIRA` to do similar, but this setup gives your whole team an awesome shared capability
