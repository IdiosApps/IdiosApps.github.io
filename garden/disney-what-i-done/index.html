It has health checks, self-healing properties, etc. like Kubernetes - but you can&rsquo;t easily <code>ssh</code> into pods even in non-prod environments easily. There&rsquo;s more reasons for the move, but basically there&rsquo;s a company-wide effort to move to EKS.</p><p>I loved using Kubernetes (with k9s!) at Sainsbury&rsquo;s, so I volunteered to lead this migration project for our team. Here&rsquo;s some things I learned whilst leading this:</p><ul><li><p>A shared knowledge base such as Google Docs works great. We captured key meeting notes, decisions, diagrams, etc. here.</p><ul><li>Anyone can get up to speed quickly</li><li>Easy to ask questions, add comments</li></ul></li><li><p>Creating a &ldquo;team training Slack channel&rdquo; for a new tech domain works great</p><ul><li>As you work through the training, questions, problems, and solutions crystallise</li><li>All information is contained neatly in the channel, not spread all over various places<ul><li>It&rsquo;s easier to collate key points and give feedback to the course owners</li></ul></li><li>You can expand the channel beyond just your team, sharing the benefits</li></ul></li><li><p>For real-time knowledge sharing, encourage various people to take tickets on the work. Pair with them for smooth KT</p></li><li><p>In refinement, it can be great to call out a ticket as a pairing ticket - a &ldquo;üçê&rdquo; emoji in the title is a nice reminder that some felt they had something new to learn from it</p></li></ul><h1 id=jenkins>Jenkins</h1><ul><li>Consider adding a &ldquo;notes&rdquo; text parameter to some builds. Even if you don&rsquo;t update the build description with this, it can be very useful to know why some builds were run (e.g. manual perf testing of a branch - what change, what is expected)</li><li>For performance tests, put time-stamped links to observability platforms (DataDog, Grafana, etc.) in the output - it really helps the ergonomics of diagnosing any issues. Lower barrier to entry helps keep performance high!</li><li>Be mindful of how many messages you&rsquo;re sending to Slack, and where. If there&rsquo;s just a little traffic, it can go to a visible team chat. If it&rsquo;s noisy, it&rsquo;ll probably go to a chat where people don&rsquo;t look as often!</li></ul><h1 id=github-actions>GitHub Actions</h1><p>Apart from linting, auto-fixing, formatting, etc. there are some really cool things you can do with GHA and GH</p><ul><li><p>Have a fairly complex/tedious workflow for e.g. building docker images and performance testing them on a branch? Use ChatOps to listen to a command and let an Action do it for you</p><ul><li>It can reply with a comment, linking to the builds, perf tests, dashboards, etc.</li><li>It can describe what process it is doing, for more explicit documentation</li></ul></li><li><p>Use Chinthakagodawita&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate>autoupdate</a> action to keep PR&rsquo;s up-to-date with the <code>main</code> branch</p><ul><li>If you have <code>auto merge</code> enabled, you can use the <code>PR_FILTER</code> of <code>auto_merge</code><ul><li>Done reviewing 5 PRs? Hit auto merge on them, and this will keep them merging until they&rsquo;re all done!</li><li>Without this, you&rsquo;d have to wait and press &ldquo;merge from main&rdquo; four times. That could be like 10-30 minutes being distracted!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Open source contributions:</p><ul><li>Coursier&rsquo;s <code>setup-action</code> is &ldquo;A GitHub Action to install Coursier and use it to install Java and Scala CLI tools.&rdquo;. It can set up various Java verisons and distributions.<ul><li>We use Amazon Corretto at work, and AWS. I [added Corretto to the jvm-index repo](<a href=https://github.com/coursier/setup-action>https://github.com/coursier/setup-action</a> <a href=https://github.com/coursier/jvm-index/blob/master/src/Corretto.scala)>https://github.com/coursier/jvm-index/blob/master/src/Corretto.scala)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=docusaurus>Docusaurus</h1><p>I was familiar with Hugo&rsquo;s Doks static site generator, and was happy to try a new SSG here: Docusaurus.</p><p>We were on Docusaurus 1, and we had a lot of complexity with the sidebar, document ordering, etc.. - so I was happy to simplify things and upgrade us to Docusuaurs 2. Here&rsquo;s a few tips:</p><ul><li>Set up <a href=https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-pr-preview>PR preview</a>, so non-developers can see what their changes look like<ul><li>You might need to &ldquo;recreate&rdquo; the Action from scratch to avoid nesting (it&rsquo;s a composite action) - see <a href=https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action/issues/33>this issue</a></li></ul></li><li>Consider adding comments to your site, so people can reach out with the context directly above. <a href=https://utteranc.es/>utteranc.es</a> can help with this</li><li>Add light/dark src/css/custom.css to match the rest of your project&rsquo;s branding</li><li>For user-facing documentation, add a FAQ page. This could save a lot of time helping resolve confusion on your most common questions!</li></ul><h1 id=meetings>Meetings</h1><ul><li>Enable closed captions<ul><li>Having the auto-generated subtitles should be accurate enough to help some of your team follow the conversation</li><li>If the auto-generated subtitles are garbage, you probably need to spend some budget on upgrading microphones. If the computer can&rsquo;t understand you, maybe humans are having an issue too!</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=calendar>Calendar</h1><ul><li>If a meeting is recorded, but a link to the recording in the invite. It gives a real home to the recording, rather than just a Slack message that gets lost. Helpful for people coming back from holiday/sickness - can flick through Calendar and get straight into the meetings they need to catch up on</li></ul><h1 id=build-caching>Build caching</h1><p>Compiling your apps from scratch every time is a waste of time & energy.
Some build tools support delta/partial compilation - if only 1 file in 1000 changed, we can base our compile around that.
GitHub Actions has a few options for caching dependencies, e.g. <a href=https://github.com/actions/cache>https://github.com/actions/cache</a> or <a href=https://github.com/coursier/cache-action>https://github.com/coursier/cache-action</a>. That <em>could</em> help a little.
Some build tools have a remote cache - that&rsquo;s great for quicker builds on CI. But, if you don&rsquo;t have a remote cache - what can you do?</p><p>Our team uses our own <code>mill</code> build tool container. It already ran some basic checks to check it&rsquo;d work with our project and could initialise some &ldquo;workers&rdquo; - but didn&rsquo;t do any caching. Here&rsquo;s what I did:</p><ul><li>Use a wrapper <code>millw</code>, a bit like <code>gradlew</code>. This would allow the container to build for any <code>.mill-version</code>, by downloading the necessary tooling<ul><li>If we merge a build tool upgrade in our main repo, builds would still work without requiring a manual rebuild on the new version of this image. Not technically efficient due to the redownloads of the build tool, but ultimately removing some toil in making things a little smoother for humans.</li><li>Compile, check formatting, fixing, etc. to generate these outputs in <code>out</code>, as well as downloading dependencies</li><li>To prevent being over-written, run <code>mv /root/build/out /root/out-cache</code>. In Jenkins jobs for app builds, move this cache back (if the build is parameterised with using the cache). Dependencies cache doesn&rsquo;t need moving.</li><li>The cache doesn&rsquo;t have to be used. It adds some size, but storage is cheap and saved time/energy is valuable. We use it for PR builds (not <code>main</code> - that&rsquo;s clean), and</li></ul></li></ul><p>The outcome of this is that, several minutes are shaved off each module (more or less, each microservice) build time. <em>Faster PR compilations means faster PR checks, which means delivering value faster and reducing our mean time to recovery.</em> It also means faster builds for ChatOps triggering branch builds + perf tests, giving fast feedback on performance critical code changes!</p><p>I was pleased with doing this, as using <code>deltas</code> like this has seemed awesome to me for a long time. I was amazed as a teenager when one Android custom ROM could deliver OTA updates 10x smaller than anyone else, by using deltas.</p><h1 id=performance-tests>Performance tests</h1><p>In your performance testing platform (we use Gatling), consider what types of test you want to have, and what should be compared:</p><ul><li>nightly, load (main)<ul><li>I made them run for longer (why not? nobody is manually testing on the <code>perf</code> env at 3am)</li><li>I made them run at peak RPS for 75% of the run time (configurable). Previously, only about 20% of the time was at peak RPS. Choose a traffic shape gives your services a proper workout!</li></ul></li><li>soak (main)<ul><li>Have seen dependencies clash and lead to slow memory leaks; soak tests protect us from this, run over the weekend</li><li>I oversaw various performance test changes around this time after identifying improvements with the team in a post-mortem.</li><li>Here, we basically decrease the load a little bit (75% of nightly) and run for much longer</li></ul></li><li>load (branch)<ul><li>results could be very far from average results on <code>main</code>, so have separate simulation to keep your &ldquo;usually good&rdquo; simulations clean</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=git-hooks>Git hooks</h1><p>Git hooks are great - ensure your code is linted/compilable/tested before pushing.
What&rsquo;s even cooler is combining them with interactive CLI tooling like <code>gum</code> - see my <a href=https://github.com/IdiosApps/gummy-hooks>&ldquo;gummy hooks&rdquo;</a> examples.</p><ul><li>Iterate quicker by using a bash script and just calling it - you don&rsquo;t actually have to do anything with Git to iterate on it.</li></ul></div></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=IdiosApps/IdiosApps.github.io issue-term=title theme=preferred-color-scheme crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-between"><div class=col-sm-4><p class=footer>James Clark ¬© 2023</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 d-flex flex-row-reverse"><a class="footer-social px-2" href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdiosApps/IdiosApps.github.io/gh-pages/index.xml target=_blank><i class="fas fa-rss"></i></a>
